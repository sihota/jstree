Event Bubbling or Event Capturing?
There are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM, bubbling and capturing.

Event propagation is a way of defining the element order when an event occurs. If you have a <p> element inside a <div> element, and the user clicks on the <p> element, which element's "click" event should be handled first?

In bubbling the inner most element's event is handled first and then the outer: the <p> element's click event is handled first, then the <div> element's click event.

In capturing the outer most element's event is handled first and then the inner: the <div> element's click event will be handled first, then the <p> element's click event.

With the addEventListener() method you can specify the propagation type by using the "useCapture" parameter:

addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
